# IP Indicator

![indicator](https://github.com/bovender/unity-ip-indicator/raw/master/images/screenshot.png)

A Ubuntu [indicator](http://unity.ubuntu.com/projects/appindicators/)
to display the current IP address.

Tested on Ubuntu 14.10 with Unity.

# Installation

  1. Checkout source code.
  2. Auto-run `indicator-ip` on system start-up.

# Modifications by bovender

I implemented the ability to switch between 'internal' (local network) and
'external' (translated internet) IP addresses. The indicator shows the external
IP by default.
